# cavez.io
Multiplayer browser cave flying game

Currently contains very immature framework of
- Server side + client side physics (no proper corrective actions + latency handling)
- Basic rendering of ship + background, no levels yet
- Geckos.io sockets (WebRTC) with default configuration, only works on chrome?
- Support for multiple connections (no proper interpolation)
